## ü§® What is this?

**A project consuming the Pok√©API (a classic for a front-end dev, hehe)**

- This is a front-end-only application
- The Pok√©API is the only external data source
- The goal is purely learning and improvement
- The use of external libraries was avoided whenever possible
- Every idea, structure, and design was made by me

## üë®üèº‚Äçüíª Main Technologies/Tools Used

**Development**
- Preact (framework)
- TypeScript (language)
- Styled-Components (CSS in TS)
- Axios (HTTP client)
- TanStack Query (query & cache manager)
- TanStack Virtual (helps with virtualization)
- NanoId (ID generator)

**Design**
- Figma

## üöÄ Running Locally

The application is hosted on [Vercel](https://poke-info.vercel.app/),
but if you want to explore or make modifications locally, just do the usual:

```shell
    git clone https://github.com/cicero-mello/poke-info.git
```
```shell
    cd poke-info
```
```shell
    npm i
```
```shell
    npm run dev
```
Finally, open [localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173/).

## ü§Ø Final Considerations

Since this project is focused on learning and improvement, I decided to experiment with different patterns throughout the application. For example, screen-specific components can be found in either ```/screen-x/components``` or ```/components/screen-x```. This diversity also applies to other aspects, such as the use of imports.

Below are my notes on Notion, where I document insights gained during development and decisions made throughout the project.
